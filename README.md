# FooBar

### This is a simple guide for GitHub.

### Steps
1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Type: `mkdir FooBar` This will allow you to make a folder
3. Type: `cd FooBar` This will goto the folder
4. _Optional_ Type: `echo My First Readme > README.txt` to make a Readme file 
5. Type: `echo foo > foo` to make a file called `foo*`
6. Type: `echo bar > bar` to make a file called `bar*`
7. Type: `git init` to initalize `git`
8. Type: `git add ` to add everything
9. Type: `git commit -m "first commit"` to create a commit
10. Type: `git remote add origin WhateverName` to create an origin to `push` to
11. Type: `git push -u origin master` to `push` to the repo

Foo and bar are nonsense words.
For any issues, go on the issues tab and click `New Issue`.

Replace WhateverName with the URL of the repo that you are trying to create. Be sure to create a git repo with a name, public, and no Readme or license.
